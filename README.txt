DATE: December 19, 2025
ENGINEER: Aarav Mahara

STATUS: WORKING 🚀

COMMAND TO RUN:
  python3 ignite.py

HOW TO CHANGE VIDEO:
  1. Open folder: explorer.exe .
  2. Delete 'test.mp4'
  3. Paste new video and rename to 'test.mp4'

MY FIXES:
  1. Compiled dlib manually.
  2. Wrote 'ignite.py' to drive the logic.
  3. Fixed 'head.py' to use int() for OpenCV coordinates.
  4. Downloaded the 68-point landmark model manually.
